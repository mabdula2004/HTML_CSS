        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are an contemporary home furnishing store headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Founded by Joan and Jamie Brooke, children of immigrants who dreamed of creating beautiful homes in their new country, the goal is to enable everyone to create the home they envision without breaking the bank. Whether you’re looking to redecorate a room or renovate an entire house, we’re here to help you find the furniture and accessories that will make that dream a reality. Also sells high quality gifts, the kinds that you’ll love giving as much as people love to receive.</p>
